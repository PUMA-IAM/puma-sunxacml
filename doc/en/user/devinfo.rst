Helping With Development
========================

Welcome to the developer pages, and thanks for your interest in this
project. There's lots to do, and we'd like to see many people get
involved. Whether you want to spend an hour a week working on some
small pieces of this project, or you really want to get hacking on the
guts of the source, there is work for you to do. In order to keep the
quality of the project high, however, and to help keep the anarchy to
a minimum, we present here 10 simple rules to getting involved in this
project. Drum-roll, please.

#. Read and understand the `contributor's form <contributors.pdf>`__
   and the `project license <license.txt>`__. Before you contribute
   anything to this project you must complete and return the
   contributor's form.
#. `Talk with us <mailto:sethp@users.sourceforge.net>`__ about how you
   want to contribute. You may already have some project or extension in
   mind, or you may want to look at the `task list <tasks.html>`__ that
   we're already maintaining. The task list has a number of very specific
   things that need to get done, as well as some more abstract ideas to
   get your mind churning. The tasks range from very simple to somewhat
   complex, so you should go check it out if you're wondering what you'd
   like to do.
#. Request access to the `sunxacml-devl` list. This is listed off the
   project page under "mailing lists." The list is private, and you will
   not be included until you've done steps 1 and 2.
#. Read the `programmer's guide <guide.html>`__ if you haven't already
   done so. This will give you a good foundation in both the XACML
   language and how some of the APIs in this project work.
#. Read the `XACML spec <http://www.oasis-
   open.org/committees/xacml/repository/cs-xacml-
   specification-1.1.pdf>`__, or at least get comfortable with the
   basics. You may not be working on much code that deals directly with
   the specification, but you should be familiar with how XACML works
   before you touch any of the code in this project.
#. Familiarize yourself with the code and the build process. This
   project uses `ant <http://ant.apache.org>`__ which should make things
   pretty easy for most everyone. The code is laid out in directories
   that mirror the package structure, so again it should be pretty easy
   to find your way around. If you have questions about what you're
   seeing, feel free to post them to the forums.
#. Read the `developer's rules <devrules.html>`__. These are the rules
   that all developers on this project live by. They're here to help you
   understand the processes we use, and also to maintain a high level of
   quality. If you have any questions about these rules, you should mail
   the `sunxacml-devl` list.
#. Pick a task and get to work! We look forward to seeing you adding
   to this project.
#. Get your code reviewed. This is one of the most important
   development rules. Every piece of code gets looked at by at least two
   people before it gets added to the codebase.
#. If by this point you're still crazy enough to want in, we'll add
   you to the list of developers. Now you can start working with the rest
   of the team and continue contributing as much or as little as you
   like.

We hope you'll look this list over, decide it sounds reasonable, and
start contributing. If you have any questions, please post them on the
forums and we'll try to address them as soon as possible. Have fun!
