<h1>Helping With Development<a class="headerlink" href="#helping-with-development" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the developer pages, and thanks for your interest in this
project. There&#8217;s lots to do, and we&#8217;d like to see many people get
involved. Whether you want to spend an hour a week working on some
small pieces of this project, or you really want to get hacking on the
guts of the source, there is work for you to do. In order to keep the
quality of the project high, however, and to help keep the anarchy to
a minimum, we present here 10 simple rules to getting involved in this
project. Drum-roll, please.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Read and understand the <a class="reference external" href="contributors.pdf">contributor&#8217;s form</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="license.txt">project license</a>. Before you contribute
anything to this project you must complete and return the
contributor&#8217;s form.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:sethp&#37;&#52;&#48;users&#46;sourceforge&#46;net">Talk with us</a> about how you
want to contribute. You may already have some project or extension in
mind, or you may want to look at the <a class="reference external" href="tasks.html">task list</a> that
we&#8217;re already maintaining. The task list has a number of very specific
things that need to get done, as well as some more abstract ideas to
get your mind churning. The tasks range from very simple to somewhat
complex, so you should go check it out if you&#8217;re wondering what you&#8217;d
like to do.</li>
<li>Request access to the <cite>sunxacml-devl</cite> list. This is listed off the
project page under &#8220;mailing lists.&#8221; The list is private, and you will
not be included until you&#8217;ve done steps 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Read the <a class="reference external" href="guide.html">programmer&#8217;s guide</a> if you haven&#8217;t already
done so. This will give you a good foundation in both the XACML
language and how some of the APIs in this project work.</li>
<li>Read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/repository/cs-xacml-specification-1.1.pdf">XACML spec</a>, or at least get comfortable with the
basics. You may not be working on much code that deals directly with
the specification, but you should be familiar with how XACML works
before you touch any of the code in this project.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the code and the build process. This
project uses <a class="reference external" href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a> which should make things
pretty easy for most everyone. The code is laid out in directories
that mirror the package structure, so again it should be pretty easy
to find your way around. If you have questions about what you&#8217;re
seeing, feel free to post them to the forums.</li>
<li>Read the <a class="reference external" href="devrules.html">developer&#8217;s rules</a>. These are the rules
that all developers on this project live by. They&#8217;re here to help you
understand the processes we use, and also to maintain a high level of
quality. If you have any questions about these rules, you should mail
the <cite>sunxacml-devl</cite> list.</li>
<li>Pick a task and get to work! We look forward to seeing you adding
to this project.</li>
<li>Get your code reviewed. This is one of the most important
development rules. Every piece of code gets looked at by at least two
people before it gets added to the codebase.</li>
<li>If by this point you&#8217;re still crazy enough to want in, we&#8217;ll add
you to the list of developers. Now you can start working with the rest
of the team and continue contributing as much or as little as you
like.</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll look this list over, decide it sounds reasonable, and
start contributing. If you have any questions, please post them on the
forums and we&#8217;ll try to address them as soon as possible. Have fun!</p>
