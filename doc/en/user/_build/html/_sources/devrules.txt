Developer Rules
---------------
We're hoping that many people will participate in our project, but
we're also assuming that people will come from different backgrounds
and have different levels of experience. With that in mind, here are
the rules that all developers on this project must respect and stick
to. This will help maintain the readability of the code, the quality
of the project, and the effectiveness of the team as a whole. Cool?

#. You don't get added to the dev team until you've shown us some
   code. Not that we don't trust you but...well, ok, we don't trust you.
   We're security people :) Seriously, we just want to see some code
   before you get added to the list of developers so we have a sense of
   your coding skill/style.
#. Always let people know what you're working on. If you decide to
   take an item from our task list, or if you start working on a new
   idea, let everyone on the development team know about it. Someone else
   might already be doing it, or might be interested in working on it
   with you. It's all about good communication folks!
#. Always get your code reviewed before you check it in. There are no
   exceptions to this rule. We want to make sure that at least two people
   have looked at every line of code. Code reviews catch bugs, improve
   readability, and make sure that multiple people are familiar with
   every part of the system, so they're a good idea all around.
#. Always make sure your code builds. We cannot stress this enough. No
   code should be checked back in unless your whole code base builds. At
   some point we'll also have tests as part of the project, and then
   we'll extend this rule to passing all the tests too. Until then,
   you're getting off easy :)
#. Always make sure that you've told the development team about
   checkins and what changed, preferably giving far advance notice if any
   changes will affect other code. We want to make sure that everyone is
   familiar with any changes happening in the system and how they may
   affect anything under active development.
#. We use the `Java coding conventions
   <http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/>`__ (basically) in this project.
   You should get familiar with them and with the style of code in this
   project. No code should be checked in that has a different look and
   feel, since we want to keep it easy for people to read through the
   whole codebase. These conventions include keeping every line to under
   80 characters and making each tab be 4 spaces (instead of a tab
   character). There are no exceptions to these rules.
#. Finally, discuss things on the sunxacml-devl list. Communication is
   key to a good project, and we want to make sure that everyone knows
   what's going on and has a chance to provide input. If you have
   questions about anything, or are considering some different approaches
   to a problem, by all means bring it up on the list.

As always, if you have any questions about this, feel free to send
mail to the developers or post to the forums. We're waiting to hear
from you!
